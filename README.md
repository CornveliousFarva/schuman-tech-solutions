Re-doing my portfolio page in HTML and CSS

Last year, my life was pretty badly turned upside down-family health problems, exacerbated by a series of deaths (one pet, along with my grandpa and dad in quick succession), forced me to take a hiatus from coding, after having completed a coding bootcamp and staying active with coding after the class had ended.

INDEX.HTML
Index.hmtl is the landing page, showing the viewer my personal logo, along with a mission statement: Dedicatio, Integritas, Caritas, which means Dedication, Integrity, Charity.

ABOUT.HTML
About.html is me-my why, who I am, what I want to do with this career.

PROJECTS.HTML
This is a showcase of my projects. As things progress, I will be showing off some of my newer and older projects.
